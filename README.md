## Clonclusion:
The average profitability of all 1,012 companies dropped significantly, from 5.84% in the first year to a negative -32.21% in the third year, indicating that the sector faced considerable challenges.
The top 10 companies had relatively stable and positive profitability, increasing from 1.48% in the first year to 3.58% in the third year. This suggests that these companies were able to adapt better to market conditions or implement effective strategies to maintain profitability.
The bottom 10 companies showed a dramatic and worsening decline in profitability, from -1.52% in the first year to -136.27% in the third year. This indicates that these companies struggled significantly over the period, possibly due to inefficiency, poor management, or market conditions that negatively impacted their operations. The large negative values, especially in the second and third years, could also indicate insolvency, large financial losses, or asset write-offs, leading to potential liquidation.
The general trend shows that while some companies were able to weather the storm, the sector overall faced considerable difficulties. The contrast between the top and bottom performers could be due to differences in company size, market share, financial stability, or business models.
